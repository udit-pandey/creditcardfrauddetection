# lambdaArchitecture
Implementation of lambda architecture in big data engineering by developing a credit card fraud detection system. <br/>
This implementation focuses more on the engineering part where we use different tools available in the big data ecosystem to solve the problem. Ideally, ML is used to classify a transaction as FRAUD/GENUINE, however, here we make use of some predefined rules. Leaving this part, all other components remain the same. <br/>
